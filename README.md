# Dividend Stock data 

Obtain the preferred stock file from WSJ, format it, and sort by dividend yield, highest to lowest, then acquire the next ex-dividend date.  

WSJ provides a daily CSV file at [market data](http://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/Preferreds.csv)

This is the closing table from the previous days' business and should be good enough for this program.

Note:  this program should also work with several of the other files obtained in the WSJ market data section as long as it is in a csv format.
